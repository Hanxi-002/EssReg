\usage{
bayesVarSel(z, y, imps, er_res, thresh = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a response vector of dimension \eqn{n}}

\item{imps}{a vector of cluster indices to keep}

\item{er_res}{a list output by the function link[EssReg]{plainER} or \link[EssReg]{priorER}}

\item{thresh}{a numeric constant used in determining convergence}

\item{x}{a data matrix of dimensions \eqn{n \times p}}
}
\value{
a list including the clusters, pure variables, mixed variables, the significant
cluster indices, and the features found in the significant clusters
found by ER
}
